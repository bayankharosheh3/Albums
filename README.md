## Description
Responsive React application that consumes the JSONPlaceholder Albums API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums). The application consists of three pages: a main page with infinite scrolling functionality, a search bar for filtering albums by title, and the ability to redirect to individual album pages (/albums/{albumId}). Additionally, there is an album page that displays all album images using infinite scrolling, and a 404 page for non-existing album IDs. I did not use any CSS libraries and ensured full responsiveness across various devices. Axios was used to fetch data from the API. This project demonstrates my proficiency in consuming APIs, implementing infinite scrolling, handling routes, and creating responsive React applications. I integrated caching of fetched data using Redux Toolkit, allowing for efficient retrieval of previously fetched album data and reducing the need for repeated API calls. Furthermore, I implemented search history functionality using Redux Toolkit."
